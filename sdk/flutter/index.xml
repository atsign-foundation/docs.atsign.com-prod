The AtClientManager is in charge of overseeing and managing all client services.It makes NotificationService, SyncService, and Client application preferences easier to access from its instance.It is also used for client method calls.
Based on your need you can either install at_client_mobile or at_client and import. After that you will be able to make an AtClientManager Instance. Now to Initialize the AtClient instance , the setCurrentAtsign method needs to be called.</description></item><item><title>AtClientPreference</title><link>https://docs.atsign.com/sdk/flutter/at_client_preference/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.atsign.com/sdk/flutter/at_client_preference/</guid><description>Overview #
AtClientPreference is used to configure the preferences of an atPlatform application. It offers a variety of attributes to give a developer ultimate flexibility.

What&amp;rsquo;s Covered #
This is where you can quickly learn and update yourself on various atPlatform concepts.
If you haven&amp;rsquo;t already, we recommend you head to Get Started Flutter Development first.
The following is covered in this codelab:</description></item><item><title>Key Basics</title><link>https://docs.atsign.com/sdk/flutter/key_basics/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.atsign.com/sdk/flutter/key_basics/</guid><description>Overview #
To store data, atPlatform utilizes a straightforward key-value method. A key serves as a unique identifier in key-value pairs.
AtKey Structure:
Attributes Description Return Type key Unique Identifier for the data String sharedWith The atSign to share with String sharedBy The atSign that is sharing String namespace The namespace of the app String metadata Metadata isRef Bool Metadata #
Metadata In AtKey allows you to add more aspects of AtKey.</description></item><item><title>Onboarding</title><link>https://docs.atsign.com/sdk/flutter/onboarding/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.atsign.com/sdk/flutter/onboarding/</guid><description>Overview #
The atPlatform uses secret keys for authenticating an atSign as cryptographically secure replacement for usernames and passwords. To improve developer experience, the atPlatform offers the at_onboarding_flutter package which handles secure management of these secret keys. If you are developing a new atPlatform app, we recommend that you use at_app which can create atPlatform app template that already contains an example of using the at_onboarding_flutter widget.
Once the onboarding widget is opened, the user can click one of the four options:</description></item></channel></rss>
