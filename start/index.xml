IoT–Internet of Things–is a system of interconnecting devices, mechanical or electronic, that are designed to work together to provide a service, such as the transmission of information, or the control of a device.
In simple terms, an IoT device is any device (such as a camera, a smart phone, a thermostat, a TV, a computer, etc) that is connected to the internet. IoT devices have sensors that are always collecting data and sending it through the Internet.</description></item></channel></rss>
